# Analytical pipeline of the hackberry petiole gall psyllid (Pachypsylla venusta) genome

This document is a walkthrough of the methods and code used to analyze the chromosome-level genome assembly. In the paper, we used HiC and Chicago libraries to build the chromosome-level assembly and analyzed gene content and sequence evolution of chromosomes. We also produced male and female resequencing data for detecting the X chromosome; male and female RNA-seq data for identifying sex-biased genes.

## 1 - Genome Assembly Verification:
