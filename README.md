# Analytical pipeline of the hackberry petiole gall psyllid (*Pachypsylla venusta*) genome

This document is a walkthrough of the methods and code used to analyze the chromosome-level genome assembly. In the paper, we used HiC and Chicago libraries to build the chromosome-level assembly and analyzed gene content and sequence evolution of chromosomes. We also produced male and female resequencing data for detecting the X chromosome; male and female RNA-seq data for identifying sex-biased genes.

## 1 - Genome Assembly Verification

### 1.1 - BUSCO analysis

### 1.2 - X chromosome assignment based on sequencing depth of males and females

## 2 - Genome Structural and Functional Annotation

### 2.1 - Genome structural annotation using BRAKER2

### 2.2 - Genome functional annotation using GhostKOALA and PANNZER2

## 3 - Genome Synteny Analysis

## 4 - Location of Sex-biased Genes

## 5 - Location of Symbiosis-related Genes

## 6 - Estimating *dN/dS* ratios
